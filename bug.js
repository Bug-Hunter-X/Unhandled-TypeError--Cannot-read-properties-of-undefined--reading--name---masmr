This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's a common error, but can be difficult to track down in React Native because the error message isn't always clear.  For example, consider this code:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch user data
    fetchUserData().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text>  // Error here if user is null
    </View>
  );
};
```

If `fetchUserData` hasn't completed yet, `user` will still be `null`, leading to a runtime error. The error message might just say something generic about a missing property.
